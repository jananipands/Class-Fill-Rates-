# Class-Fill-Rates-
Searches college classes based on Course Registration Number (CRN) and outputs class fill rates and availability. 

Given the De Anza CRN (Course Registration Number) and the desired minimum fill rate, this program will output the list of classes above the fill rate entered and the course name of that class.
